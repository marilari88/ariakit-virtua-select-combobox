# Ariakit + SelectComb Virtualized Demo

This repository contains a demo project showcasing the implementation of a select combobox with a virtualized list using the Virtua library.

## Project Overview

The project aims to demonstrate the efficient rendering of large lists in a select combobox using virtualization. Virtualization is a technique where only the visible portion of a list is rendered at any given time, improving performance for large lists.

The project uses the Ariakit library for the select combobox and the Virtua library for list virtualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `yarn`.
4. Start the project using `yarn dev`.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can interact with the select combobox. As you scroll through the list, you'll notice that even with a large number of items, the performance remains smooth. This is due to the virtualization provided by the Virtua library.
